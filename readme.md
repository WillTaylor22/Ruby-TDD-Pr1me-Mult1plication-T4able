# Multipl1cation Ta8le of the First N Pr1mes

This script was a code challenge for a London-based Fintech. I have obfuscated some words in this readme to prevent the code being find-able by other applicants, spoiling the challenge.

This shows a test-driven (TDD) approach. The code is clean, easily human-readable, and has been compartmentalised into sensible classes and methods. The algorithm chosen is one of the fastest available for solving this type of problem.

## The Challenge

* The program must run from the command line and print a table to
STDOUT .
* The first row and column of the table should have the N primes, with each cell
containing the product of the primes for the corresponding row and column.
* Allow the user to specify different table sizes through a command line option. If the
option is not used, the table should contain the first 10 primes by default.
* Consider complexity. How fast does your code run? How does it scale?
* Do not use the Prime class from the Ruby stdlib (write your own code).
* Write tests. Try to demonstrate TDD/BDD.
* If youâ€™re using external dependencies please specify those dependencies and how
to install them.

## The Solution

I used a Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to quickly generate primes, and displayed this in a simple table.

### Installation

To install, clone this repository and from the terminal run:
`$ bundle install`

To print the table of the first N pr1mes:
`$ ruby lib/run.rb N`

For example: `$ ruby lib/run.rb 4` prints
```
     2  3  5  7
  2  4  6 10 14
  3  6  9 15 21
  5 10 15 25 35
  7 14 21 35 49
```

if N is omitted, the script defaults to N=10.

### Running Tests
`$ rspec`

`$ bundle exec guard` # Runs guard in terminal. Guard runs the relevant tests for a file when it is saved.

### Automatic Test Installation Notes

Note to self - does not need to be done now

https://github.com/guard/guard

https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec

`$ bundle exec guard init` # Initialises guard

`$ bundle exec guard init rspec` # Install rspec plugin for guard
